		<p>Our Maple Wood Prints are printed directly on to 1/2&#8221; thick maple surfaced wood board, for a warm and natural-looking print that is also eco-friendly. The grain and other characteristics of the wood shows through the light and white areas of the image for a natural warm tone and vintage feel. Each wood print is unique and no two prints will look precisely alike. Our Maple Wood Prints will have the 1/2&#8221; border and they will have a natural finish.</p>	
		<p>We use a Wood Float Hanger that mounts the Wood Print 1/2&#8221; from the wall for a &#8220;float&#8221; effect.</p>
